Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward.
What do you see? â€” Posted like silent sentinels all around the town,
stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries.
Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads;
some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China;
some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep.
